Your Personal Git Push Formula (copy → paste → adapt)
When you are ready to push (you have committed everything):

Make sure you're on the correct local branch
(usually your feature/fix branch — not main/develop)Bashgit branch
# or
git status→ You should see * feature/something or * fix/somethingIf not → switch first:Bashgit checkout feature/your-branch-name
# or
git switch feature/your-branch-name
Always fetch latest remote state first (very important!)Bashgit fetch origin
Decide which branches you want to update today
Write them down (example):
 feature/payment-screen
 fix/login-crash-2026
 develop
 main

Push to each one separately — one line per branchNormal (recommended) push — only if fast-forward is possibleBashgit push origin HEAD:feature/payment-screen
git push origin HEAD:fix/login-crash-2026
git push origin HEAD:develop
git push origin HEAD:mainShorter version (when you're already on the branch you want to push from):Bashgit push origin feature/payment-screen
git push origin fix/login-crash-2026
git push origin develop
git push origin main
If any push gets rejected (“non-fast-forward”, “rejected”, “! [rejected]”)Then decide per branch:
Option A — safest: pull + merge/rebase firstBashgit fetch origin
git rebase origin/main          # or origin/develop, etc.
# fix conflicts if any, then
git push origin HEAD:main
Option B — overwrite remote (only if you're sure!)Bashgit push --force-with-lease origin HEAD:main
# or shorter
git push -f --force-with-lease origin mainNever use plain --force / -f unless you really understand the consequences.


One-page cheat sheet you can save
text# Every time you want to push the same work to several branches:

1. git fetch origin
2. git status               # everything committed?
3. git branch               # on the right branch? (feature/xxx or fix/xxx)

Then for each branch you want to update:

   Normal push:
   git push origin HEAD:branch-name

   OR shorter:
   git push origin branch-name

   If rejected → either:
   • git rebase origin/branch-name   → then push again
   • git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD:branch-name
Quick example for your current situation
Assuming you're on feature right now:
Bashgit fetch origin

# Most common — just update your feature branch
git push origin feature

# Also update main (only if you really want to)
git push origin HEAD:main
# or if it rejects:
# git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD:main
